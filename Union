Strathclyde Union

Over the years, thousands of students have been part of the Union. The Union will forever be changing, but it remains true to its original purpose: to place students at the heart of Strathclyde through representation, sport, clubs, societies, support, socialising and anything that is a priority for student life during their time at Strathclyde.
